# 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction with MLflow

This project compares two powerful machine learning algorithms — **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBoost Regressor** — on the California Housing dataset, while using **MLflow for end-to-end experiment tracking**.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ Full **MLflow Integration** for tracking experiments
- 📊 Comparison between **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**
- 🔍 Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- 📈 Logs metrics (MSE, RMSE), model parameters, and input/output signatures
- 🧪 Experiment data visible in **MLflow UI**

## 🗂 Folder Location

```
C:\Users\adiis\Housing_Data_MLflow
```

---

## 📦 Installation

Install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### requirements.txt includes:
- numpy  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- xgboost  
- mlflow

## 🧪 How to Use

### Step 1: Start MLflow UI

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Open the MLflow dashboard:  
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)

---

### Step 2: Run the Script

```bash
python mlflow_housing.py
```

This will:
- Train both Random Forest and XGBoost models
- Perform hyperparameter tuning
- Log everything to MLflow: metrics, parameters, models, and more

---

## 📊 MLflow Logs Include:

- `best_max_depth`, `n_estimators`
- `mse`, `rmse`
- Trained model artifacts
- Input/output signature for model reproducibility

All visible in the MLflow dashboard at:  
[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)
